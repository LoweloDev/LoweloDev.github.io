# Sandbox/Playground(ReactJs & Spring Boot & Spring Data JPA + H2 Database & REST Api Endpoints)

Frontend also fetches DB structure from Github just like the backend since it served as a React.js sandbox before backend even existed. Hence this is a disconnected mess and I was in the process of tidying it up and replicating backend functionality in the respective backend when a potentailly similar but expanded usecase came up, which is currently in private repo and will be done cleanly via Quarkus, RestEasy Reactive, Hibernate ORM Reactive, PostgreSQL Reactive and Websockets, together with a React.js frontend.
